# Boeing Dice Game

Take home assignment - Boeing interview
## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Each time the application is run it'll play exactly one game. 
Do mvn spring-boot:run to run it again

A series of console logs are done to help follow the execution. Those would not be where they are in a real application.

## Running tests
```shell
mvn test
```
